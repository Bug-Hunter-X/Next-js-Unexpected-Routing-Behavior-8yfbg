# Next.js Unexpected Routing Behavior

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to routing in Next.js.  The issue involves unexpected behavior when navigating between pages using a combination of the `Link` component and the `useRouter` hook.  Under certain conditions, navigation might fail or lead to unexpected page renders. 

## Bug Description

The primary problem is that navigating from the `About` page back to the `Home` page using `useRouter.push` doesn't always update the UI correctly. It may not render the `Home` page completely, showing a partially updated state. This is inconsistent with the expected behavior. 

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to the '/about' page.
5. Click the button to go back to the home page. Observe the potential unexpected rendering.

## Solution

The solution involves more robust state management and ensuring that any asynchronous actions related to page navigation are properly handled.
